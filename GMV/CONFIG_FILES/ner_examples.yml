Diagnosed at age 14, she reports intermittent bouts of wheezing and breathlessness, often exacerbated in cold weather and during physical exertion. She is currently using salbutamol inhaler as a relief medication approximately two to three times per week, with no current preventative inhaler therapy.\n\n**Physical Examination:**  \nMs. Wright is in no apparent distress. Her respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute and unlabored, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Auscultation of the lungs reveals expiratory wheezing noted bilaterally; however, there are no added sounds. Her cardiovascular examination is unremarkable.\n\n**Laboratory Tests:**  \nLung function tests indicate a reduced FEV1 at 65% of predicted value. Peak flow measurement is recorded at 320 L/min, which falls below the patient's expected value based on height and age.\n\n**Diagnosis:**  \nIntermittent asthma with suboptimal control.\n\n**Management Plan:**  \n1. Initiate low-dose inhaled corticosteroid treatment with beclometasone 100 mcg twice daily.\n2. Continue using the salbutamol inhaler as a rescue medication.\n3. Provide asthma action plan and patient education on the importance of steroid adherence.\n4. Review technique of inhaler use, providing a spacer to optimize delivery.\n5. Arrange follow-up appointment in two months to evaluate control and adjust treatment as necessary.\n\n**Comments:**  \nMs. Wright requires better prophylactic control of her asthma symptoms. The introduction of an inhaled corticosteroid is aimed at reducing her reliance on short-acting beta agonists by improving baseline asthma control. A follow-up spirometry is planned to assess response to therapy.\n\n"
